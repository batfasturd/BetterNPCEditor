# BetterNPCEditor

This is a basic editor I created to help me edit JSON files used by the Rust plugin Better NPC.

To use it, load your directory with your oxide/data/BetterNpc files, it will load subfolders as well.
Select a .json file on the left side and it will load the configuration on the right side.
Double click to edit entries. Press save changes and upload the config file to your server.

Reload your BetterNpc plugin and your server should be using the new config.

You will need the .net 8 desktop runtime to make this work. Either download the release or compile yourself using Visul Studio.
